Rules:

- Dependencies only point "down" the pipeline. `diagnostics` depends on nothing.
- Only `backend` knows about Cranelift. The frontend never imports it.
- The parser produces syntax only (grammar: `docs/grammar.md`). Name binding, types and ownership state live
  in side tables keyed by node ids, never inside the AST.
- Every token, node and IR instruction carries a `Span`.
- Platform-specific code (Linux syscalls, linker invocation) lives in `runtime`
  and in a `platform` module of the driver, not in the frontend.

## Dependency policy

Each external crate needs a line in this table with a justification.

| Crate | Used by | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `serde_json` | tools/lsp | JSON-RPC messages and robust JSON encoding/decoding |
| `url` | tools/lsp | Correct file URI encoding/decoding, including escaped paths |
| `cranelift-codegen/frontend/module/object/native` | backend | ISA/codegen, SSA builder, symbols, ELF object emission; pinned 0.125.3, dependency audit in ADR 0027 |

## Tarn package security (planned)

Future package operations use the single `tarn` CLI, version-free imports,
`tarn.toml` intent and a verified exact `tarn.lock` graph. Packages are data until
explicitly granted constrained execution authority. No package manager, registry,
resolver or sandbox is implemented. Requirements and open choices are in
[dependency security](dependency-security.md).

The Cargo crates above and the embedded-runtime system `cc` invocation below are
existing trusted compiler/toolchain boundaries. They do not authorize future
package install hooks or imply current sandbox enforcement.

## Linking

Cranelift ELF object + embedded `runtime/native.c`, compiled/linked through system
`cc -std=c11 -O0 -fno-strict-aliasing -no-pie ... [-l<granted>] -lm`, run with
`LC_ALL=C`; `--link` libraries are validated build-time grants (ADR 0047). Linux x86_64 only;
requires a C toolchain with libc/libm headers. No installed runtime archive needed.
ABI, canonical layout, output paths and limits: [ADR 0027](adr/0027-native-backend.md).

## Caching (planned)

Use a content-addressed global store, conceptually `~/.tarn/registry/`,
`~/.tarn/sources/` and `~/.tarn/artifacts/`; exact disk layout remains open.
Deduplicate verified sources by content. Artifact keys include source hash,
compiler/toolchain identity, target, options and resolved dependency graph identity.
Interface hashes, names or mutable tags alone cannot establish cache identity.
Reuse must respect content verification and security policy, including authorized
build inputs. This is a future design constraint; no cache optimization starts here.
See [dependency security](dependency-security.md).

## Executable destruction boundary

After successful ownership checking, the driver produces `CheckResult.drops`: a
separate `tarn_ir::post_drop::Program` with explicit destruction plans, runtime
flags and verified CFG edges. A backend consumes it without reading move/borrow
results. See [ADR 0026](adr/0026-drop-elaboration.md). Inspect it with
`tarn ir file.tarn --drops`. Native code generation consumes this boundary; see [ADR 0027](adr/0027-native-backend.md).

Native feature completion after phase 7 adds reachable generic specialization,
concrete generic ADTs, borrowed fat slices, nonescaping borrowed closures and
checked shifts/float-to-int casts. Unknown bootstrap stdlib APIs now fail with
E3040. See [ADR 0028](adr/0028-native-feature-completeness.md) and
[ADR 0029](adr/0029-checked-shifts-and-float-casts.md). Optimization remains deferred. Shared/mutable invocation borrows callable storage; consuming invocation moves it. Owned closure destruction uses ordinary post-drop functions (ADR 0032).
Borrowed dynamic references use private `(data, vtable)` pairs and resolved
frontend implementation IDs (ADR 0030). Declaration-derived passing/result
contracts and `borrows(...)` clauses expose invisible implementation promises
(ADR 0031); the backend still receives no move/borrow results.


## Native task boundary (phases 11A/11B/11C)

`Callee::TaskSpawn` records generated worker/result-destruction function IDs and
specialization arguments. Both functions pass through ordinary IR verification,
move/borrow checking and post-drop elaboration. The post-drop verifier validates
the callable/result shapes and owned argument. Backend specialization reserves
these functions through its existing work list. Small C ABI adapters bridge to
their private canonical ABI; the runtime never inspects capture/result types.

`Task<R>` has the canonical eight-byte private handle field declared in core;
its result is owned through runtime metadata, not an inline field. Native drop
of this resource waits and dispatches its verified result destruction function.
Explicit join moves result bytes to caller storage before releasing allocations.
The linker includes `-pthread`. Representation and abort semantics:
[ADR 0033](adr/0033-safe-native-tasks.md). Transfer/Share are bounded structural type-checker queries with explicit native
capability evidence. Scoped spawn carries a TaskScopeWitness reference, whose
ordinary loan flow prevents handle escape. Scope-owned handles and discarded
Task temporaries retain worker loans until consuming join/destruction. Lowering
completes task-containing resources before borrowed storage ends, including early
exits. Synchronization uses owned Mutex containers, ordinary guard loans and concrete atomic storage; no backend ownership queries are introduced.
See [the 11B report](scoped-tasks-report.md) for conservative restrictions.


## Synchronization boundary (phase 11C)

Core declares Mutex<T>, MutexGuard<T> and AtomicBool/I32/I64/U32/U64/Usize.
Resolved declaration identities supply trusted resource and capability contracts.
Mutex owns a private native pointer and an inline T payload. A guard stores private
native/payload address lanes but semantically carries its mutex loan. Declaration-
aware loan containment propagates guards through functions and aggregates. Guard
destruction is a liveness use, and a whole move transfers its held loans. Ordinary
NLL prohibits moving/destroying the owner or escaping a guard-derived reference.

Existing move/init classification and executable Value/Guard destruction plans
select exactly which complete resources are destroyed. Native type glue unlocks
a live guard; complete Mutex glue recursively destroys its T using the existing
canonical destruction path, then destroys/frees the native mutex. No alternate
runtime owner bit or backend move/loan query is involved. Private pthread helpers
never inspect or destroy T. Guard read has an explicit Copy obligation in the
trusted intrinsic catalog, reusing normal generic checking without conditional
method-owner syntax. value() borrows payload access and replace() moves values.

Concrete atomic owners hold private heap-backed C11 atomic scalar storage. All
operations are sequentially consistent, and checked fetch arithmetic uses CAS
loops without signed C overflow. Public compare_exchange returns a strong success
boolean; failed comparison leaves storage unchanged. No unsynchronized projection
of the scalar exists. See [ADR 0033](adr/0033-safe-native-tasks.md) and
[the Phase 11 report](phase-11-report.md) for the API, tests and v0 limits.

## Blocking native networking

Phase 12A loads the embedded `stdlib/net` module with explicit trusted-source
metadata. Public socket/error/address types remain outside core. Ordinary Tarn
implements the application API, retries, error mapping and write_all; private
C helpers bridge Linux socket/getaddrinfo ABI and capture native status.
Transfer/not-Share contracts belong to resolved native declarations. Socket
destruction executes verified post-drop plans; the backend does not infer owner
liveness. The IR verifier validates private signature, owner and outcome shapes.
Slice pointers/lengths are explicit ABI lanes, never escaping runtime storage.
See [ADR 0034](adr/0034-blocking-networking.md) and [networking](networking.md).

## Readiness boundary (Phase 12B)

The trusted net catalog adds Poll and exact Token/Event bridge shapes. Poll drop
uses existing post-drop resource destruction; no ownership registry is added.
C owns epoll bookkeeping with nonreused tokens and Linux socket cookies. Public
Tarn code controls mode changes, connect progression, WouldBlock and monotonic
EINTR retry policy. No application pointer remains pending after a syscall.
See [ADR 0035](adr/0035-nonblocking-readiness.md).

## Manual suspended execution (Phase 12C)

Operation<R> stores an ordinary owned mutable closure and a loan-bearing Waker.
Existing capture metadata exposes across-poll storage and loans; the generic
loan-resource destruction/liveness mechanism includes Waker-containing holders.
Execution owns Poll/mechanical wake bookkeeping; a separate Executor owns a
bounded operation table, avoiding self-reference. Task insertion consumes and
returns that table through ordinary provenance. Native helpers only manage
identity, registration and coalesced wake bits. Tarn schedules fair turns and
implements all network state transitions.
See [ADR 0036](adr/0036-suspended-execution.md) and
[the Phase 12C report](suspended-execution-report.md).

Phase 13 source async (ADR 0037): lowering keeps an async body as an ordinary IR
function with explicit `Suspend { resume, abandon }`/`Abandon` edges, so move,
borrow and drop elaboration analyze it unchanged. After verified drop
elaboration, `ir::async_frame` relocates suspension-live locals and all flags
into a stable heap frame and makes the state dispatch explicit. The backend only
places slots at frame offsets and emits poll/destruction adapters.

## Lexical paths (Phase 15C)

`stdlib/path` is an ordinary Tarn module over owned UTF-8 strings. Bundled source
is a fallback, not a trusted intrinsic provider; local modules can override it.
Path capabilities, loans and destruction are entirely structural. No runtime
or backend ABI changes are needed. Applications pass borrowed path text to fs.
Explicit lexical normalization is separate from filesystem resolution. See
[ADR 0044](adr/0044-lexical-owned-paths.md).

## Blocking child processes (Phase 15D)

`stdlib/process` is a trusted layer above io. Tarn owns configuration, child
completion, capture buffers and two native pipe-reading tasks. Private bridges
use posix_spawnp, GNU libc spawn actions, read, waitpid and kill. Dedicated
resolved resource/intrinsic metadata is structurally verified, including
consuming signatures binding resource identities. Process drop waits; pipe
drop closes. Backend code executes verified plans without inferring ownership.
There is no shell interpreter, process registry, detach or async integration.
See [ADR 0045](adr/0045-blocking-processes.md).

## Bounded HTTP/1.1 (Phase 16)

`stdlib/http` is an ordinary bundled Tarn module, with local override and editor
source support but no native privilege. It owns bounded request/response/header
bytes and a Connection containing TcpStream plus both existing net buffers.
Protocol states govern transaction ordering, never descriptor liveness. Parsing,
framing, preflight, deadlines and response encoding remain in Tarn; runtime/backend
execute only existing I/O, timers, wake operations and verified post-drop.
The concrete-result runtime.run_timeout consumes a local Operation and writes
stage data through ordinary caller loans. No generic result can escape a destroyed
manual poller. Native test tracing observes frames/buffers/wakers/task allocations
without providing an ownership registry. See [HTTP](http.md) and
[ADR 0046](adr/0046-bounded-async-http.md).

## Application ergonomics (Phase 17)

`stdlib/json` and the `string.Builder`/`http.serve` additions are ordinary Tarn
with no runtime or intrinsic changes. Two backend changes support them: `[0]T`
markers no longer inspect `T` for layout, and vector element destruction calls
on-demand per-type functions, so owned types may recurse through `Vec`. The
type checker lets a non-consuming closure literal adopt an expected `mut fn`.
The native bind bridge sets SO_REUSEADDR for TCP. See
[ADR 0048](adr/0048-application-ergonomics.md).
