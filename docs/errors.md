# Diagnostics (draft 0)

Diagnostics are part of the product. Every diagnostic has:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `code` | Stable identifier: `E` + 4 digits for errors, `W` + 4 digits for warnings |
| `severity` | `error`, `warning`, `note` |
| `kind` | snake_case machine name (e.g. `use_after_move`) |
| `message` | one line, lower case, no trailing period |
| `file`, `line`, `column` | 1-based position of the primary span |
| `labels` | spans with short messages (primary and secondary) |
| `notes` | extra facts ("`buffer` was moved on line 12") |
| `help` | an actionable suggestion, when one exists |

## Code ranges

| Range | Phase |
|-------|-------|
| E0001–E0999 | lexer |
| E1001–E1999 | parser |
| E2001–E2999 | name resolution |
| E3001–E3999 | types |
| E4001–E4099 | moves |
| E4101–E4199 | borrows |
| E4201–E4299 | lifetimes / reference escapes |
| E9001–E9999 | driver, I/O, backend |

Codes are never reused. `tarn explain E4001` (future) prints the long form from
`docs/errors/E4001.md`.

## Text format

```
error[E4001]: use of moved value `buffer`
  --> src/main.tarn:13:11
   |
12 |     b := buffer
   |          ------ value moved here
13 |     print(buffer)
   |           ^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: `Buffer` is not a copy type
   = help: borrow it instead: `b := &buffer`
```

## JSON format

`tarn check --json` prints one JSON object per line (JSON Lines) so tools can
stream them:

```json
{"code":"E4001","severity":"error","kind":"use_after_move","message":"use of moved value `buffer`","file":"src/main.tarn","line":13,"column":11,"labels":[{"file":"src/main.tarn","line":13,"column":11,"end_line":13,"end_column":17,"primary":true,"message":"value used here after move"}],"notes":["`Buffer` is not a copy type"],"help":"borrow it instead: `b := &buffer`"}
```
