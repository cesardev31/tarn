# Tarn grammar (as implemented by `tarn_parser`, phase 2)

EBNF-ish notation: `{x}` zero or more, `[x]` optional, `|` alternative,
`NL` a `Newline` token. Newline handling (ADR 0008) is summarized after the
grammar; inside `( )`, `[ ]`, `< >` and literal braces every `NL` is skipped.

## Operator precedence (loosest first)

| Level | Operators | Associativity |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 0 | `..` `..=` | none — `a..b..c` is E1017 |
| 1 | `\|\|` | left |
| 2 | `&&` | left |
| 3 | `==` `!=` `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | none — `a < b < c` is E1006 |
| 4 | `\|` | left |
| 5 | `^` | left |
| 6 | `&` | left |
| 7 | `<<` `>>` | left |
| 8 | `+` `-` | left |
| 9 | `*` `/` `%` | left |
| 10 | prefix `-` `!` `&` `&mut` `try` `await` | right (prefix) |
| 11 | postfix `.name` `(args)` `[i]` `Path{...}` | left |

Bitwise operators bind tighter than comparisons (unlike C), so
`a & mask == 0` means `(a & mask) == 0`. `try` is a prefix operator:
`try a.b() + 1` is `(try a.b()) + 1`.
`try await f()` is `try (await f())`; `await f() + 1` is
`(await f()) + 1`. Async blocks, async closures and nested function items are
not introduced. The modifier is recognized on free and inherent method items;
async interface/impl declarations remain outside the supported surface. Async
bodies lower onto Phase-12C suspended execution (ADR 0037).

## Newlines (ADR 0008)

1. Inside `( )`, `[ ]`, generic `< >`, struct literal and array literal braces:
   ignored.
2. Inside blocks and item bodies: they end statements/members.
3. Skipped after a binary operator, prefix operator, `:=`, `=`, `=>`, `.`.
4. In postfix position, newlines followed by `.` continue the chain.
5. A line starting with a binary operator is a new (invalid) statement:
   E1002 with a hint.
6. `else` must follow `}` on the same line: E1016.

## Disambiguation rules

- The parser is deterministic: bounded lookahead, no backtracking (ADR 0011).
- `IDENT :=` → immutable binding; `IDENT :` → annotated binding
  `x: T := e`. Nothing else starts with `IDENT :` in statement position.
- The draft-0 forms `x T := e` / `var x T = e` are diagnosed (E1018) with a
  fix-it; the check scans the line for `:=` only to produce that diagnostic.
- `scope` followed by `{` at statement start is a scope block; otherwise an
  identifier.
- `any` followed by an identifier in type position is a dynamic type.
- `self` / `&self` / `&mut self` is a receiver only as first parameter.
- A `{` after a path-only expression (`User`, `geometry.Point`) starts a
  struct literal, except in `if`/`for`/`match` heads (E1009 if one is found).
- `>>` closing two generic argument lists and `&&` in prefix/type position are
  split into two tokens.
- A bare identifier pattern is not classified by the parser (binding vs. unit
  variant is name resolution's job).

## Not in the implemented subset yet

Everything in `docs/language.md` used by the 28 examples is parsed. Explicit
generic arguments in expressions are a v0 restriction (ADR 0012). Not yet
designed or parsed: attributes, `const`/statics, type aliases, raw pointer
types `*T`, guards beyond a single expression, labeled breaks, numeric literal
suffixes, char literals, doc-comment attachment to items.

## Phase 9 declaration provenance extension

After the optional return type, a function/interface declaration may contain:

```
borrow_clause = "borrows" "(" identifier { "," identifier } [ "," ] ")"
```

`borrows` is contextual here, not a globally reserved keyword. Semantics require a
bodyless borrowed-result declaration and distinct reference inputs (`self` is
allowed for a borrowed receiver). A clause on a body is rejected, and normal
body provenance remains inferred. ADR 0031 defines validation and source indices.

`move` and `once` are contextual before `fn`; `mut` remains reserved syntax.
